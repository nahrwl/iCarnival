# iCarnival
The Official Punahou Carnival App

## How to Build:
1. Clone this repository or download the source, and open the project in Xcode.
2. Locate Keys.xcconfig and open it.
3. There are five variables defined within (e.g. FABRIC_API_KEY) that need values. Retrieve the corresponding API keys for both Parse and Twitter Fabric and paste those keys in the appropriate place inside Keys.xcconfig.
4. Build and run the app! Remember, be sure never to share your secret API keys publicly.
